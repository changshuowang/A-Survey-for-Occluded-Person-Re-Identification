## Datasets

The papers related to datasets used mainly about Occluded Person Re-Identification are as follows.

- **[`[Occluded-DukeMTMC]`](https://github.com/lightas/ICCV19_Pose_Guided_Occluded_Person_ReID)** Occluded-DukeMTMC was collected from DukeMTMC-reID, containing 15,618 training images of 708 pedestrians, 2,210 query images of 519 pedestrians, and 17,661 gallery images of 1,110 pedestrians for testing. Of these images, 9% of the training set, 100% of the query set, and 10% of the gallery are occluded images. Obstacles include cars, bicycles, trees, and other pedestrians, adding complexity to the dataset.

## Metrics

The papers related to metrics used mainly in RGBD semantic segmentation are as follows.

- **[PixAcc]**  Pixel  accuracy
- **[mAcc]**  Mean accuracy
- **[mIoU]** Mean intersection over union
- **[f.w.IOU]** Frequency weighted IOU

## Performance tables

Speed is related to the hardware spec (e.g. CPU, GPU, RAM, etc), so it is hard to make an equal comparison. We select four indexes namely PixAcc, mAcc, mIoU, and f.w.IOU to make comparison. The closer the segmentation result is to the ground truth, the higher the above four indexes are.
